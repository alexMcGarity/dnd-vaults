Halfling
Warlock (Celestial pact)

Acel is by far the most spoiled and sheltered member of the family, Anastasia keeps him away from guests, won't let him venture too far from the main estate, and has one of the main servants stick with him at all times. Acel receives an allowance from his mom. Acel does not fully realize that the allowance is magic gifted from his mom. This pact also gives her a very strong influence over his sense of thinking and cannot freely make choices on his own. (kinda like the Geas spell)
