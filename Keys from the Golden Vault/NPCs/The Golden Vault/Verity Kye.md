At the start of the heist:
A skilled three-dragon ante player and a shrewd tiefling entrepreneur, Verity Kye toured the gambling circuit for years, making a name for herself and winning numerous large tournaments.

While on the circuit, Verity met a gnome gambler named Quentin Togglepocket. The two hit it off, and they formed a plan to save enough winnings to open their own casino. Just as they seemed poised to put their plan in action, Quentin disappeared, taking all their money with him—only to resurface years later, having built the Afterlife Casino using the stolen money.

Now, Verity needs the characters to break into the vault at the Afterlife Casino, steal the erinyes statuette meant to be the prize for the casino's three-dragon ante tournament, and retrieve her share of the money from the vault. For Verity, it's not the money or the statuette that matters—it's ensuring that Quentin's betrayal comes back to haunt him, and that he knows the person he betrayed made him pay.
