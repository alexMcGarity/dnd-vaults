Background:Friend to [[Dain Wynsata]] and mother of [[Verona Wynsata]]

She found Dain injured in the woods after a hunting accident, and saved him. It was love at first sight. She fell pregnant, so even when she and Dain (mutually) decided to just be friends, he stuck around to be a father. The tavern was owned by her late-aunt, who had no children and left it to Dorlamane because she started working at the tavern as a teen and had a knack for it.
