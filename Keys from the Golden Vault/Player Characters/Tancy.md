The current holder of [[Eliad]]’s profile is named Tancy. Tancy was able to replicate Eliad’s appearance at the age of thirteen and has been training/studying since then to take over as the next Eliad. Now that they are twenty, Tancy has been given the journal of Eliad’s adventures and sent off to continue to do that good work. Tancy is eager to prove themself as another worthy carrier of Eliad’s name and mission. Tancy decided to head [[Varkenbluff]] in order to start the continuation of Eliad’s journey. Tancy has also been tasked with continuing their family’s bloodline so that Eliad can continue for the next generation.
