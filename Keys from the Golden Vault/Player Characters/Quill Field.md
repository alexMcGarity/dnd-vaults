Quill is a middle child (fourth born) from a large family on a homestead in the middle of nowhere. She and her other siblings were trained on their family's remote homestead, and they have to forge and farm to survive. They raised what little livestock they had, which includes birds and other small livestock. 

While relatively remote, the local lord was irritated by the persistence of her family, stopping at nothing to make sure they were dirt poor forever.

Quill was sick of the cycle of poverty, and she knew that someone had to break out of the homesteading life to bring the family income. She convinced her parents that she would go into the city and civilization to get educated and bring money to the family. She manages to convince them of her plot, and she sets out with her loyal raven companion, Ink. 

[[Ink]]’s alleged main purpose is to travel between the homestead and Quill. Quill has a magic earring and Ink had a necklace that connects them. The charms were given to Quill and Ink as a parting gift when they left the homestead.
The homestead has a charm that Ink can go to. They do this for all their domesticated birds so they don’t get lost. [[Quill's Magic Earring]]

Quill’s plan was instead to travel and experience the world, and steal to send her family money. She lurks in the shadows, observing the modern world instead of participating as an outsider. Quill learned by experience to pickpocket, and pick locks in order to send money to her family, and keep up her current lifestyle as a traveler. 

Quill recently had a good haul by robbing an important noble, who unknown to her, was actually [[Mahadi the Rakshasa]]. She was able to feed her family for a long time and some neighboring families with her haul. It has put her on the radar for [[The Golden Vault]], even though she secretly wasn't aware of who she was robbing. She takes full credit for it however, and has been doing bigger robberies of banks and rich folk with her newfound confidence. She now finds herself in [[Varkenbluff]]
