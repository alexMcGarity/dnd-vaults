* Old war drone manufactured by dwarves
* fixed up by [[Abbie Atkins]]
* memories of what he was before are scarce but he is aware that he was forged for an important purpose which is all but forgotten
* The real purpose for which he was forged was to kill [[Asmodeus]] using the [[Anti-Wish Weapon(AWW)]]
* after being fixed, he started adventuring
* he was working with Abbie and the tinkerers/builders so now he does it religiously as a devotee of Hephastus, because it seemed to help them
