Alchemist Artificer

Hailing from the golden beaches of [[Var]]. Woe would be born into an unusual family. Woe's mother would die while giving birth to Woe. Leaving only Woe and her father, [[Aid]]. Aid would be a well known bounty hunter in the golden water area. He would teach Woe the basics of bounty hunting. While Woe would be more interested in magic and learning how to enchant objects. At the age of 24 his father would die suddenly to an outbreak of death dog. On Aid's deathbed, he told Woe about an organization based in [[Varkenbluff]] called Golden Vault. Determined to do right by her father, Woe sets out to join [[The Golden Vault]], and make a difference in the world.
