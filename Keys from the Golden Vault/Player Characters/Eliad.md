Eliad is a blood-bound profile of a family of changelings.The profile is a high-elf paladin who swore to protect society from the meddlings of evil creatures and other-worldly beings. The profile of Eliad has been passed down through ten generations of changelings (around 600 years). Eliad’s appearance has not changed through these years and the profile has been used to do good and protect others throughout Faerun. Eliad’s family currently resides in a secretive changeling society outside of Waterdeep.

The next holder of Eliad’s profile is named [[Tancy]]. Tancy was able to replicate Eliad’s appearance at the age of thirteen and has been training/studying since then to take over as the next Eliad. Now that they are twenty, Tancy has been given the journal of Eliad’s adventures and sent off to continue to do that good work. Tancy is eager to prove themself as another worthy carrier of Eliad’s name and mission. Tancy decided to head [[Varkenbluff]] in order to start the continuation of Eliad’s journey. Tancy has also been tasked with continuing their family’s bloodline so that Eliad can continue for the next generation.
