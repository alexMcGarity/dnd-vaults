The Afterlife Casino lies three miles north of the nearest town. It's an architectural marvel built into a natural cavern carved by a river nicknamed the River Styx. Since the real River Styx is a route to the afterlife, [[Quentin Togglepocket]] named his establishment the Afterlife Casino.

After passing through the casino, the river pours over a waterfall into a larger body of water (which could be a lake or an ocean, depending on where you set the adventure). The waterfall isn't a safe way to enter or leave the casino.
