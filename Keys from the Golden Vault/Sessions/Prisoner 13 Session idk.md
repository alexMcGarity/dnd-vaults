The Briefing:
"Prisoner 13 used to be an ally of Clan Axebreaker. She grew ambitious and power-hungry. She created a network of spies and stole the clan's gold, leaving hardly anything. We discovered her quickly after, but the gold was already gone. Her agents were all questioned and executed. But the gold was nowhere to be found. She is serving a life sentence in prison. Recently, I discovered where she stashed the fortune, but I haven't been able to get in. Only SHE knows how to open it. And no matter what, she refuses to talk. And that's where you guys come in. I have spent the last of my fortune trying to uncover the key. If you help me, I promise you the undying gratitude of my clan, and of course, a cut of the treasure."

I have agents standing by to capture a number of guards and cooks so that you can take their places.

# Session Recap

After getting back to Baldurs Gate, the party finds that 5 years had passed. They decide to go out and visit their respective families for a month and reconvene back in Baldurs Gate. After getting back, Abbie comes back with a letter, and asks if the party can go to Forgetown. The party goes to Forgetown (Abbie's hometown) and has a day off, visiting the hot springs and Abbie's family. They stay the night at her cousins inn, and go out to see the dwarf the following day. Abbie takes the party into [[Gauntlgrym]](the dwarven hold) to see Varrin Axebreaker. He explains the ins and outs of their mission to retrieve the key to Clan Axebreaker's treasure from Prisoner 13. Afterward, Abbie says goodbye to the party, and plans to follow through with her plan to attend university.
