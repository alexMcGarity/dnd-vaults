* isabella familiar lore dump:
	* Bile Long ago, my imp was a human who sought great power and wealth. In a moment of desperation, they made a deal with Mahadi, the master of the Wandering Emporium, trading their soul for the fulfillment of a dark desire. This is still unknown to Sophie. However, as the imp soon realized, deals with Mahadi are rarely straightforward. Mahadi, in his cunning ways, not only fulfilled the imp's immediate desire but also transformed them into an imp to serve him eternally. The imp's soul was encapsulated within a soul coin, becoming a currency in Mahadi's possession. Mahadi assigned the imp to serve his daughter, Sophie Caelum, a druid with a deep connection to nature. This arrangement serves Mahadi's dual purpose of keeping a watchful eye on his daughter and ensuring the imp's loyalty through its bound soul. Personality and Traits: The imp is greedy and a sadist/masochist. Deep down Bile knows he was changed mentally when he was transformed and knows he’ll never be the person he was again. If his old self could see him today he’d be horrified.
