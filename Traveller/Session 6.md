They disable the generator and as they do so a security corvette arrives and the group is introduced to captain Wescott who offers his assistance with the situation, he tells the group to seize the security room. The group lands in the hangar and has mere seconds to disable the heavy cannon. Alec manages to shoot the EMP shell to disable the cannon. Infinia argues with Baxter until he gets annoyed and leaves. The group enters into the lobby and fights 3 security droids. They kill them, Alec and David find a strange item, that's a gold tile with a table with numbers and letters etched into it. The table has several tiles punched out of it.
