The group goes to the first lab of plasma research, they fight security droids. Once the fight ends, James tries to examine the plasma without much luck. In the next lab, the group is tasked with finding out why the other half of the room doesnâ€™t exist. Stumbling around in a liminal white space until infinia finds a softbox light that emits a white light that hides things when shined on it. The group moves into the next room, where they find Dr. Klein trapped in a pod. As they find a way to help him escape, the pod sinks into the ground. After 10 min, two pods each holding a Dr. Klein in it is revealed. Baxter taunts the group. The group must decide which Dr. Klein has the bomb in them. The group decides to shoot one, but Dr. Klein tells them it would end in disaster. Infinia and Edmund find out, and Edmund disarms the bomb. Dr. Klein thanks them and leaves in an escape pod. The group then fights their way through the cantina and enter into the living quarters. The group goes into each of the doctors' living spaces and reads their journals. They then fight auto turrets in the navigation and life support room.
