+ We wake up in a mine with drow women mining rocks and ore and shit
+ their eyes are glazed over
+ there is a short guy attached to a web (david's character, Norm Human)
+ Drider crawling across the ceiling (drow spider) (its a boy)
+ I polymorph the drider into an ant
+ driders are chasing down this dude who stole their platinum eggs, who we intercept and decide to run after
+ they take us to this abandoned castle, that they are working very hard to maintain
+ we are suspended on a small web as the drider queen descends on us
+ the dude was apparently a thief god named [[Mask]]
+ the eggs hold [[Lolith]]'s' heir
+ we agree to help her get her eggs back in exchange for a way out of the [[Webbed Hellpits]]
+ The gates open up to [[Mask]]'s lair 
+ david talks to some theives guys but gets ambushed and chained up
+ everyone basically hates [[Mask]]
